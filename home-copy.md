    This year's theme is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">assistive technology.
    <br><br></span>Stay tuned. \U0001F4FB<br><br>Outside of that, we organize meetups,
    networking events, panel sessions, entrepreneurship workshops / masterclasses,
    and site events with the aim of introducing the undergraduate community to the
    MedTech sector, whilst bridging the worlds of industry and academia.<br><br>Additionally
    for students, we facilitate and source MedTech focused community projects (and
    Engineering Capstone Projects) to allow for both soft skill and technical up-skilling.
    All wrapped in a relaxed and collaborative environment."
